## 🧰 Setup Instructions

> ⚠️ Note: Please fork this repository before making any changes. All work should be done on your personal fork, not on the original repo.  
> Alternatively, you can **use this repo as a template** to start fresh.

### 1️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

> Make sure Python version 3.13+ is installed.

## Things to keep in mind:

- _NO AI CODE SHALL BE USED._ Any plagarised or code given by LLMs can be detected. Anyone found using these tactics will be barred from receiving the completion certificate.
- _NO CODE SHARING_. Every intern must have their own unique code and project style. Same rules as above for violation of this rule.
- Any number of files can be created depending on the neccesity and use.
- Do not clutter the main.py file, try and create multiple files for different logic sections (Eg: converter.py handle the conversion using gemini, filesystem_update.py creates and updated directories and files in filesystem).
